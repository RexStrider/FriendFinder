## Instructions

You will need to first clone this repo (you will need to install [git](https://git-scm.com/) to do this).

```
// cloning with ssh
git clone git@github.com:RexStrider/FriendFinder.git

// cloning with https
git clone https://github.com/RexStrider/FriendFinder.git
```

Then you will need to install the node dependencies.

Navigate to the root directory of this project using a command line interface and enter the following command (you will need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed to do this).

```
npm install
```

Once the previous steps are completed, you can run the application using the following command (make sure you are in the root directory of the project, or it won't work!).

```
node server.js
```

You should see a message in your CLI indicating the application has started.

![server has started on port 3000](./app/static/assets/images/cli-example.PNG)

After you see this message, go to your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the URL field
